Event Mania is the Event Management Web Application for college.

We provide a facility for students and teachers to register their intercollege and intracollege events on this portal.

They can easily control the entries of students for these events and can keep the track of events.

By visiting this web-portal, students can get the information about upcoming events and past events.

Also students who have registered for events can get notification about event schedule and place.
